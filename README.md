# Newsvendor Model - Stochastic Programming

Project as part of Coursework for Optimization-II taught in UT Austin MS Business Analytics Programme

## Introduction:
The newsvendor model is a popular method for optimizing inventory decisions in the face of uncertain demand. However, the model's reliance on past demand data may not accurately reflect future demand patterns. In this analysis, we explore different extensions to the standard newsvendor model that incorporate more realistic assumptions and methods.

## Methodology:
To improve the accuracy of the newsvendor model, we utilize the sample average approximation (SAA) method, which is a powerful tool for solving stochastic programming problems. We compare different approaches to using SAA to approximate future demand and profit.

## Results:
Our analysis includes three extensions to the standard newsvendor model. The first extension considers the possibility of rush orders to fulfill demand that exceeds the quantity of newspapers printed. The second extension assumes a linear relationship between price and demand, allowing for joint optimization of price and quantity. The third extension examines the sensitivity of optimal price and quantity to different samples of demand data.

## Conclusion:
By incorporating more realistic assumptions and methods, we are able to improve the accuracy of the newsvendor model and provide better recommendations for inventory decisions. Our results demonstrate the potential benefits of considering rush orders, utilizing a linear relationship between price and demand, and analyzing the sensitivity of optimal decisions to different samples of data. Ultimately, our analysis and extensions contribute to a better understanding of stochastic programming and its applications in business decision-making.
